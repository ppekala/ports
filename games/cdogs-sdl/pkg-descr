C-Dogs SDL is a classic overhead run-and-gun game, supporting up to 4 players
in co-op and deathmatch modes. Customize your player, choose from many weapons,
and blast, slide and slash your way through over 100 user-created campaigns.

C-Dogs is a freeware DOS game made between 1997-2001 by Ronny Wester, who's
also known for making Cyberdogs (1994). Although relatively obscure, it was one
of the more well-known games of its kind, and built a small following with many
fans creating custom campaigns for it. Players loved it for its simple yet
addictive gameplay and wicked explosions.

The story would have ended there had Ronny not been awesome enough to release
the source code in 2002. There it was picked up by Jeremy Chin and
Lucas Martin-King, who ported the game to SDL and made it available for
modern PCs.
