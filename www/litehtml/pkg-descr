litehtml is the lightweight HTML rendering engine with CSS2/CSS3 support.
Note that litehtml itself does not draw any text, pictures or other
graphics and that litehtml does not depend on any image/draw/font library.
You are free to use any library to draw images, fonts and any other graphics.
litehtml just parses HTML/CSS and places the HTML elements into the correct
positions (renders HTML).
